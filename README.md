## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript (ES6);

### What I learned

In html, I learned to deliver responsive images.
In css, I learned to partially style an svg.
In js, I learned to use a nav-toggle button.

```html
<img src="./images/mobile/image-transform.jpg"
        srcset="./images/desktop/image-transform.jpg 720w"
        sizes="(min-width: 720px) 50vw, 100vw"
        alt="image-transform">
```

```css
.social-links__item path {
    fill: #2c7566;
    fill-rule: nonzero;
    transition: fill .3s ease-in-out;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

In the near future I will be focusing on css positioning, pseudo-elements and learning one css preprocessor (I am thinking about sass) in order to improve in css.
